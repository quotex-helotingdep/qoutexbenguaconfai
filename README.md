Quotex, a popular binary options and CFD trading platform, offers
stop-loss orders as a key feature. In this guide, we will explain what a
stop-loss order is, how to use it on Quotex, and the benefits of using
stop-loss orders in your trading strategy.

## What Is a Stop-Loss Order?

A stop-loss order is a type of order that you can place with your broker
to automatically sell an asset when it reaches a certain price. This
price is known as the "stop-loss level." When the market price of
the asset reaches the stop-loss level, the order is triggered and the
asset is sold.

Stop-loss orders are used to limit your potential losses on a trade. If
the market price of the asset moves against you, the stop-loss order
will be triggered and the asset will be sold before your losses become
too large.

## Benefits of Using Stop-Loss Orders

There are many benefits to using stop-loss orders, including:

-   **Limit your potential losses.** Stop-loss orders help you to limit
    your potential losses on a trade by automatically selling the asset
    when it reaches a certain price.
-   **Protect your profits.** If the market price of the asset moves in
    your favor, you can protect your profits by placing a stop-loss
    order above your entry price.
-   **Reduce stress.** Stop-loss orders can help to reduce the stress of
    trading by giving you peace of mind that your losses will be
    limited.
-   **Improve your discipline.** Stop-loss orders can help you to
    improve your discipline by forcing you to stick to your trading
    plan.
